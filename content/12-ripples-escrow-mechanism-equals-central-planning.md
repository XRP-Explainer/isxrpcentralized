Title: “Ripple’s escrow mechanism equals central planning”
Summary: No, strict on‑ledger conditions automate how much XRP is released monthly, minimizing any single entity’s ability to alter the schedule at will.

## Argument  
By controlling the times and amounts of XRP’s monthly releases, Ripple allegedly exercises a form of central economic planning over the asset.

## Response  
The escrow contracts used by Ripple are enforced at the protocol level. These contracts lock up most of Ripple’s XRP, releasing only a set portion each month. Any unsold tokens then return to escrow automatically, preventing new tokens from being unexpectedly introduced outside the schedule. This system operates independently of arbitrary decisions, relying instead on the code’s predefined terms.  
Comparisons are sometimes drawn to large shareholders under lock-up periods in corporate settings, but here the rules are visible on the public ledger, leaving no opportunity for secret changes. Because participants can track and anticipate these releases, they can price them in accordingly. Rather than “central planning,” it represents a transparent, rule-based structure that fosters predictability.
