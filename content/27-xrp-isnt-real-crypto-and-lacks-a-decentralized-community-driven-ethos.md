Title: “XRP isn’t ‘real crypto’ and lacks a decentralized, community-driven ethos”
Summary: No, the code has been open‑source from inception, and independent validators worldwide confirm transactions without requiring a central authority.

## Argument  
A critique holds that corporate involvement undermines the principles of a genuinely decentralized, community-led cryptocurrency.

## Response  
Open-source code forms the foundation of the XRP Ledger, enabling any individual or group to run nodes, propose changes, or issue assets. Decentralized consensus is maintained by diverse validators—universities, hobbyists, businesses, and other stakeholders—rather than solely by a corporate sponsor. This structure supports the hallmarks of a permissionless system, including censorship resistance and self-sovereign transaction verification.  
While a well-funded company such as Ripple does contribute code and partnerships, the ledger’s consensus and operation do not hinge on its continued presence. If Ripple ceased to exist, independent validators would still retain the ability to process transactions and oversee ledger amendments. This arrangement shows that the technology, rather than corporate affiliation, defines the ledger’s level of decentralization and community involvement.
