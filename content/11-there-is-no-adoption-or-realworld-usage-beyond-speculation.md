Title: “There is no adoption or real‑world usage beyond speculation”
Summary: No, multiple corridors rely on XRP for cross‑border payments, and various applications use the ledger’s fast settlement features for practical use cases.

## Argument  
Critics claim that beyond trading and price speculation, XRP serves little to no real-world function for institutions or consumers.

## Response  
Financial service providers in certain regions have employed XRP as a bridge asset for international remittances, reducing the need to hold multiple pre-funded accounts. This approach can lower costs and expedite settlements, offering tangible benefits over conventional cross-border payment rails. Additionally, individuals and small enterprises have leveraged the ledger for everything from micropayment apps to token issuance, highlighting its flexible transaction system.  
Beyond payments, the ledger’s built-in decentralized exchange capabilities allow rapid conversion among various issued assets. This functionality broadens the scope beyond mere speculation, fostering an environment where tokens can be traded or used in everyday contexts. Such utility underscores that while speculation remains a factor, real-world usage does indeed exist for those seeking quick, border-agnostic transfers and a low-cost transactional network.
