Title: “Partnerships with banks are meaningless because banks just use RippleNet, not XRP”
Summary: No, many institutions begin with messaging solutions before adopting On‑Demand Liquidity, so the modular approach does not negate potential XRP usage.

## Argument  
Because some banks opt only for the messaging layer of RippleNet, critics see this as proof that they reject XRP altogether.

## Response  
RippleNet is a platform that offers financial institutions advanced payment messaging, while a separate component, On‑Demand Liquidity (ODL), enables cross‑border transfers using XRP. Banks may initially use the messaging service to modernize their infrastructure, reducing errors and operational costs. Over time, certain participants explore ODL as they become comfortable with digital asset settlement.  
This phased adoption is common in traditional finance, where institutions do not typically switch to new assets or liquidity sources overnight. Early partnerships thus serve as stepping stones rather than definitive rejections of XRP’s settlement capabilities. Consequently, the fact that some banks use only RippleNet’s messaging features at first does not invalidate the role of XRP within the broader system. It simply reflects a measured, compliance-oriented approach to introducing digital assets.
