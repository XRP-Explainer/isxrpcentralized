Title: “XRP is an unregistered security”
Summary: No, legal rulings have distinguished XRP itself from certain sales that may breach securities laws, indicating the token is not inherently a security.

## Argument  
A longstanding assertion is that XRP should be regulated in the same manner as a stock or bond, implying it is a security in all contexts.

## Response  
Court decisions have clarified that while some particular institutional sales of XRP may have contravened securities regulations, the token itself does not automatically qualify as a security. The legal reasoning finds that the manner in which a digital asset is marketed or sold can render it part of an investment contract, but that does not translate into the token inherently being a security.  
This distinction parallels the idea that various commodities or assets can be sold via illegal offerings, yet the assets themselves are not securities once traded independently in open markets. Consequently, regulatory discussions focus on specific sales practices rather than blanket classifications of XRP. This perspective supports the view that secondary market transactions in XRP are not subject to the same criteria as shares in a corporation or similarly registered securities.
