Title: “XRP Ledger has no security model since it’s neither Proof‑of‑Work nor Proof‑of‑Stake”
Summary: No, the ledger uses a unique consensus protocol that removes reliance on mining pools or staked capital, allowing node operators to reject malicious validators.

## Argument  
Detractors interpret the absence of a mining or staking process to mean the ledger lacks a proper security framework, leaving it vulnerable to attacks.

## Response  
The XRP Ledger is secured through Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, where each node selects trusted validators. A supermajority of these trusted validators must agree on transaction ordering and validity for the network to confirm a new ledger version. Because there is no need for high-volume hashing or stake locking, the design avoids power concentration in large mining pools or wealthy staking entities.  
If certain validators behave dishonestly, nodes can reconfigure their trust lists to exclude them. This dynamic makes it difficult for any small group to disrupt the network. Rather than relying on massive energy consumption or financial lockups, the ledger’s security arises from a broad and diverse set of validators cooperating voluntarily, each motivated to preserve correct operation for their own transactions and those of the network. The result is a security model focused on broad, user-managed consensus rather than purely economic or computational mechanisms.
