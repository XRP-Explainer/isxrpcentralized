Title: “No real developer community is building on XRP Ledger”
Summary: No, the ledger has supported decentralized exchange features and tokenization for years, attracting diverse groups of developers through grants and open-source initiatives.

## Argument  
There is a claim that XRP’s technical ecosystem is limited to a single corporate sponsor, with few independent developers taking part.

## Response  
In reality, the XRP Ledger has long included native tokenization features, a built-in decentralized exchange, and other capabilities that appeal to developers seeking fast and low-cost transaction systems. Various grant programs, community initiatives, and independent teams have emerged to offer new applications, from micro-payments to NFTs. A number of these projects operate entirely separate from Ripple as a corporation, relying on the ledger’s open-source nature for building and launching their solutions.  
Resource portals, third-party wallets, and specialized developer frameworks demonstrate an active community exchanging ideas, committing code, and testing potential enhancements. While public focus often centers on Ripple’s activities, the underlying ledger remains open to innovations from any contributor, reflecting a broader and more varied developer base than the “no community” argument suggests.
