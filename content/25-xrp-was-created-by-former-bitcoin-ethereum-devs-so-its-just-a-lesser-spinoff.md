Title: “XRP was created by former Bitcoin/Ethereum devs, so it’s just a ‘lesser spin‑off’”
Summary: No, the XRP Ledger introduced a distinct consensus model, built‑in DEX, and different priorities than Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## Argument  
Because certain developers involved had backgrounds in Bitcoin or Ethereum, some classify XRP as an inferior copy lacking original features.

## Response  
The “XRP’s a lesser Bitcoin/Ethereum spin-off” jab is a misfire that mangles the timeline. XRP Ledger wasn’t a latecomer—it rolled out as the second major blockchain after Bitcoin, years before Ethereum was a gleam in Vitalik Buterin’s eye. Far from a copycat, it shaped the game—Vitalik even tried interning at Ripple, crashing on then-CTO Stefan Thomas’s couch ’til the U.S. visa folks sent him packing. He left, wandered, and birthed Ethereum, riffing off XRPL’s early moves. Spin-off? More like trailblazer.

The roots run deep: David Schwartz and Arthur Britto chipped in on Bitcoin’s codebase back in the day—OG cred aplenty. Jed McCaleb? He built the first Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, before flipping the script with XRP. These aren’t outsiders—they’re crypto pioneers who didn’t mimic BTC but rethought it. XRPL’s consensus ditches Proof-of-Work’s coal-chugging slog—nearly 1,000 nodes seal deals in under 4 seconds, fees a whisper. It debuted the first built-in DEX, swapping XRP and tokens while BTC lumbered. One killer early use? Tokenizing and transacting Bitcoin itself—faster, leaner—years before Lightning Network was a sketch.

No PoW bloat, no PoS detour—XRPL’s fresh code aimed to fix mining’s mess and deliver utility. Native assets from the jump, BTC on board—Ethereum’s tricks owe it a nod. Schwartz, Britto, McCaleb didn’t clone; they cooked something new. Bitcoin’s a vault; ETH’s a lab—XRP’s a jet, built by vets who’d already shaped the space. Lesser? Nah—it’s a leap.
