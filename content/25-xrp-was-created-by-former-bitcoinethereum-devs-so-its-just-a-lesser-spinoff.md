Title: “XRP was created by former Bitcoin/Ethereum devs, so it’s just a ‘lesser spin‑off’”
Summary: No, the XRP Ledger introduced a distinct consensus model, built‑in DEX, and different priorities than Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## Argument  
Because certain developers involved had backgrounds in Bitcoin or Ethereum, some classify XRP as an inferior copy lacking original features.

## Response  
XRP’s consensus deviates markedly from proof‑of‑work or proof‑of‑stake, focusing on rapid finality, low energy use, and minimal transaction fees. The inclusion of a built‑in decentralized exchange also emerged early in the ledger’s lifecycle, allowing the tokenization and trading of assets without needing external smart contracts. By contrast, Bitcoin relies on PoW for security, and Ethereum eventually adopted proof‑of‑stake.  
Labeling XRP as a “spin‑off” overlooks its separate codebase and different network assumptions. The ledger’s aim was to address the perceived drawbacks of mining while embedding advanced features, such as native asset issuance. Sharing dev backgrounds with other crypto projects does not negate these innovations. Instead, it demonstrates an evolution of ideas, leading to a unique protocol that stands apart in design and functionality.
