Title: “XRP has no incentive system, so it cannot sustain a decentralized network”
Summary: No, node operators run the ledger for reliable access and cost-effective transactions, rather than for mining or staking rewards.

## Argument  
Because the XRP Ledger lacks block rewards or staking yields, some conclude that no one will maintain honest operation long-term.

## Response  
In practice, a range of parties run nodes to ensure fast, transparent, and uncensored transaction verification for their own use or for the benefit of their clients. Financial institutions, exchanges, and independent enthusiasts alike value a trustworthy infrastructure that finalizes transactions within seconds. This motivation does not require earning newly minted tokens.  
Moreover, dependence on block rewards can centralize power in large mining pools or wealthy stakers who accumulate more tokens. The XRP Ledger’s consensus avoids such concentration by eliminating the need for competitive resource expenditure or capital lockups. Instead, the ledger’s minimal overhead and direct utility drive node operation. Participants generally seek improved network integrity for payments, trading, or token issuance—objectives beyond mere reward accumulation.
