Title: “Ripple or the XRP Ledger can freeze and censor transactions”
Summary: No, the native XRP asset is not subject to freezing, and no mechanism allows arbitrary reversal or blockage of valid ledger transactions.

## Argument  
It is sometimes claimed that Ripple or particular validators hold a “freeze switch” to reverse or halt user balances, raising concerns about potential censorship.

## Response  
The XRP Ledger’s core protocol does not include any feature permitting the freezing or reversal of **native XRP** holdings. Once a transaction meets the consensus criteria, it becomes an immutable part of the ledger history. No single entity—whether a validator, node operator, or third party—can rescind or block that action retroactively.  
Confusion arises from a feature related to **issued assets** (IOUs or tokens on the ledger), whereby an issuer may configure freeze functions for its own tokens. This function, however, does not extend to XRP itself. It is simply an option for entities needing compliance controls on assets they issue. Consequently, the ledger preserves the decentralized principle for its base asset, preventing the censorship or freezing of legitimate XRP transactions.
