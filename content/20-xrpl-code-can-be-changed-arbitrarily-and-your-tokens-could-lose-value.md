Title: “XRPL code can be changed arbitrarily and your tokens could lose value”
Summary: No, the ledger’s amendments require broad consensus among independently run validators, ensuring no unilateral code changes can inflate supply or revoke balances.

## Argument  
Some propose that the rules governing XRP can shift abruptly, allowing increases in supply or confiscation of tokens.

## Response  
All major protocol changes on the XRP Ledger undergo an amendment process that demands an 80% consensus among validators for a period of time before activation. If a proposed amendment fails to maintain this threshold, it is not adopted. This structured approach prevents any single party from injecting harmful or inflationary modifications into the codebase.  
In addition, node operators maintain full autonomy in deciding whether to accept new versions of the software. Should an amendment appear detrimental to the network’s health, honest validators and operators can reject it. This distribution of power ensures that token holders rely on broad consensus rather than edicts from a central authority. The rigid consensus rules thus protect users from unexpected increases in supply or unauthorized seizure of tokens.
