Title: “XRPL code can be changed arbitrarily and your tokens could lose value”
Summary: No, the ledger’s amendments require broad consensus among independently run validators, ensuring no unilateral code changes can inflate supply or revoke balances.

## Argument  
Some propose that the rules governing XRP can shift abruptly, allowing increases in supply or confiscation of tokens.

## Response  
The “XRPL code can flip overnight and trash your tokens” scare is a ghost story that doesn’t haunt the facts. Changing the ledger’s rules isn’t a free-for-all—it’s a slog through an amendment gauntlet needing 80% of validators to nod yes for two solid weeks. Fall short of that supermajority? It’s dead in the water—no sneaky supply bumps or token grabs. Nearly 1,000 nodes aren’t puppets; they’re a sprawling crew of independent validators, and they’ve got to agree or it’s a no-go. One rogue coder can’t rewrite the game.

Here’s the kicker: node operators hold the reins—they pick which software version to run. If some sketchy amendment—like an XRP minting spree or a balance heist—rears its head, honest validators can just say “nah” and stick to the old code. It’s not Ripple’s call or any lone wolf’s whim; it’s a network-wide arm-wrestle. With that kind of consensus lock, your tokens aren’t dangling on some dictator’s thread—nearly 1,000 watchdogs ensure no one’s spiking the supply or swiping your stash.

This isn’t a centralized clown show; it’s a fortress of collective say-so. The 100 billion XRP cap’s been set since day one—on-chain, tracked, untouchable. Amendments aren’t a backdoor; they’re a public brawl with a high bar. “Lose value” from sudden rule flips? Only if the whole validator swarm loses its spine—and good luck with that.
