Title: “XRPL is not truly censorship‑resistant; validators can block transactions”
Summary: No, colluding validators lose their standing once honest nodes remove them from trust lists, making broad censorship unfeasible.

## Argument  
Because the ledger relies on validator agreement, some argue that an orchestrated group could suppress or reorder transactions at will.

## Response  
In the XRP Ledger’s consensus design, each node maintains a list of validators it regards as trustworthy. If a set of validators attempts to block valid transactions, these validators can be excluded from the trust lists used by honest participants. Achieving permanent censorship would require a significant majority of the network to conspire and uphold that action, which is unlikely in a widely distributed system.  
This model differs from a large mining pool scenario in proof‑of‑work, where a pool with over half the hashrate can selectively omit transactions unilaterally. In the XRPL environment, no single party or small group can impose censorship. Decentralization arises from diverse, independently managed nodes that can rapidly react if certain validators deviate from honest consensus practices.
