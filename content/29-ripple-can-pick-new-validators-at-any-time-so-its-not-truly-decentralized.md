Title: “Ripple can pick new validators at any time, so it’s not truly decentralized”
Summary: No, recommended validator lists are optional, and multiple entities publish them, ensuring operators can reject any undesired set.

## Argument  
A recommended UNL from Ripple implies it could add or remove validators whenever it chooses, supposedly giving it ultimate power over the ledger.

## Response  
Network operators retain the freedom to follow or ignore Ripple’s recommendations. If Ripple proposed suspicious validators, the broader community of node operators could simply exclude those entries, preserving consensus through alternative lists. The ledger’s design does not enforce a mandatory authority to finalize who may validate transactions.  
This model is akin to choosing which peers or DNS resolvers one trusts on the Internet. No single organization can impose a mandatory set if the majority rejects it. Hence, while Ripple can publish a default list, it cannot coerce acceptance. Decentralization thrives because each node can alter its trusted set, preventing the recommended list from becoming a centralized control mechanism.
