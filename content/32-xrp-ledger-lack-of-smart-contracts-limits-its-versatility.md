Title: XRP Ledger’s lack of smart contracts limits its versatility compared to Ethereum or newer chains
Summary: No, XRPL’s focus on speed, cost, and native features like tokenization and a DEX delivers specialized utility that doesn’t need smart contracts to shine.

## Argument
Some claim that without native smart contract support—like Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano offer—the XRP Ledger’s stuck as a one-trick pony, unable to host complex DeFi apps or compete in the dApp-driven blockchain race.

## Response
The “XRPL’s no smart contracts, so it’s a dud” jab is a tunnel-vision take that misses the point. XRP Ledger’s not chasing Ethereum’s dApp crown—it’s a precision tool, not a Swiss Army knife. Nearly 1,000 nodes crank out sub-4-second settlements for peanuts, with a built-in DEX—the first ever—and native tokenization that’s been minting assets since before Ethereum’s diapers were dry. It’s not “limited”; it’s laser-focused—bridging fiat, zapping remittances, trading tokens—without the bloat of programmable scripts.

DeFi’s cool, sure—Ethereum’s got its jungle of contracts—but XRPL’s lean vibe powers real moves: On-Demand Liquidity flips MXN to PHP in a flash, NFT markets like xrp.cafe churn cheap drops, and devs tokenize without gas wars. Smart contracts add flex, but also fat—XRP skips the middleman and still delivers: payments, swaps, assets, done. Posts on X from XRPL Labs tease hooks—lightweight logic layers—showing it’s not asleep, just picky. “Versatility”? It’s got plenty where it counts—speed and cost beat complexity for the job it’s built to nail.

Critics want a jack-of-all-trades—XRPL’s a master of one: fast, cheap utility. Ethereum’s a lab; XRP’s a highway—different lanes, same race.
