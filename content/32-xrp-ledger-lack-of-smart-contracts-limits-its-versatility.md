Title: "XRP Ledger’s lack of smart contracts limits its versatility compared to Ethereum or newer chains"
Summary: No, XRPL’s focus on speed, cost, and native features like tokenization and a DEX delivers specialized utility that doesn’t need smart contracts to shine.

## Argument
Some claim that without native smart contract support—like Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano offer—the XRP Ledger’s stuck as a one-trick pony, unable to host complex DeFi apps or compete in the dApp-driven blockchain race.

## Response
The "XRPL’s no smart contracts, so it’s a dud" jab is a tunnel-vision take that misses the point. XRP Ledger’s not chasing Ethereum’s dApp crown—it’s a precision tool, not a Swiss Army knife. Nearly 1,000 nodes crank out sub-4-second settlements for peanuts, with a built-in DEX—the first ever, complete with common liquidity pools—and native tokenization churning out assets since before Ethereum’s diapers were dry. Multisigs seal trustless deals right in the core—no extra fluff needed. It’s not "limited"; it’s laser-focused—bridging fiat, zapping remittances, trading tokens—without the bloat of programmable scripts.

DeFi’s slick, sure—Ethereum’s got its contract jungle—but XRPL’s lean machine delivers: On-Demand Liquidity flips MXN to PHP in a snap, NFT markets like xrp.cafe mint cheap drops, and the DEX’s pools let traders swap with zero gas wars. Native tokenization spits out assets—stablecoins, whatever—while multisigs handle escrow and sign-offs, no smart contract middleman required. Why pile on complexity when the ledger’s got DEX liquidity, token minting, and multi-party trust baked in? "Versatility"? It’s stacked where it matters—speed, cost, and ready-to-roll features outpace script-heavy rigs.

Critics crave a jack-of-all-trades—XRPL’s a master toolbox: fast, cheap, built to work. Ethereum’s a lab; XRP’s a highway—different lanes, same race.
