Title: “No cross‑border usage actually materializes, so the hype about ODL is empty”
Summary: No, On‑Demand Liquidity has facilitated real fund flows in various corridors, and usage continues to expand as participants adopt new remittance solutions.

## Argument  
Claims persist that despite public announcements, there is no genuine transaction volume or broad adoption in cross‑border payments via XRP.

## Response  
In reality, specific corridors—such as those connecting certain North American and Asian markets—have recorded consistent payment flows using On‑Demand Liquidity. Institutions in these regions leverage the ledger to transfer value across fiat currencies more quickly than traditional routes, bypassing the need for multiple pre-funded bank accounts.  
While global coverage may not be universal, incremental expansion is a typical pattern in cross-border finance, where compliance, local partnerships, and technical integration each take time. The presence of ongoing remittance corridors demonstrates that usage is not merely theoretical. As more corridors gain regulatory clarity and banking connections, ODL’s usage is likely to expand, contradicting the notion that no cross-border activity exists.
