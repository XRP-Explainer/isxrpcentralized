Title: "No cross‑border usage actually materializes, so the hype about ODL is empty"
Summary: No, On‑Demand Liquidity has facilitated real fund flows in various corridors, and usage continues to expand as participants adopt new remittance solutions.

## Argument  
Claims persist that despite public announcements, there is no genuine transaction volume or broad adoption in cross‑border payments via XRP.

## Response  
The "ODL’s just hype, no real cross-border action" gripe is a head-in-the-sand take that doesn’t match the map. On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) isn’t sitting idle—real fund flows are pulsing through corridors like North America to Mexico and Japan to the Philippines, where XRP zips value across borders faster than SWIFT’s creaky rails. Nearly 1,000 nodes back the XRP Ledger, and outfits like Tranglo, and SBI Remit are tapping it to flip fiat—USD to MXN, JPY to PHP—in seconds, no pre-funded nostro accounts clogging the pipes. This isn’t a press release fantasy; it’s cash moving, now.

Growth’s not instant—cross-border finance is a slog of compliance, local handshakes, and tech hookups. ODL’s rollout mirrors that grind: steady, not splashy. RippleNet, the separate non-blockchain network, hooks banks with messaging, but ODL plugs into the XRP Ledger for the heavy lifting—real-time settlement, no middleman fat. Corridors in Asia (Japan, Singapore) and Latin America (Mexico) aren’t just pilot blips—transaction volumes are climbing as remittance firms like Intermex and fintechs like FINCI ditch the old playbook. Posts on X from Ripple hype ODL’s live lanes—40 payout markets by 2023, 90% of the $6 trillion daily FX churn—showing it’s not vaporware.

Skeptics want overnight global domination—sorry, that’s not how it works. Regulatory green lights and bank buy-in take time, but the traction’s real: XRP’s bridging USD to MXN or JPY to PHP isn’t "theoretical"—it’s logged, tracked, and growing. Ripple’s a company pushing the gas, sure, but the XRP Ledger’s open—others can (and do) jump in. "No usage"? Tell that to the funds flowing while the naysayers nap.
