Title: “Blockchain is not needed; cross‑border or domestic transfers work fine otherwise”
Summary: No, the XRP Ledger provides 24/7, near-instant settlement beyond the capabilities of traditional banking rails such as SWIFT or ACH.

## Argument  
Some suggest that legacy systems like SWIFT, SEPA, or ACH already fulfill payment needs without requiring a specialized blockchain asset.

## Response  
Existing bank networks can take days to settle international transactions and often involve multiple intermediary fees. By contrast, an XRP Ledger transaction finalizes within seconds at any time, with minimal overhead costs. Individuals and businesses not only benefit from speed, but also from the ledger’s ability to move value across borders without maintaining pre-funded accounts in numerous currencies.  
While alternatives like stablecoins or other blockchains exist, the XRP Ledger’s focus on fast finality and minimal transaction costs differentiates it. The methodical bridging of currencies—known as On‑Demand Liquidity—offers an additional layer of utility by reducing the capital required in traditional nostro/vostro accounts. Hence, while conventional transfers do “work,” the ledger’s features represent an improvement in speed, convenience, and global reach.
