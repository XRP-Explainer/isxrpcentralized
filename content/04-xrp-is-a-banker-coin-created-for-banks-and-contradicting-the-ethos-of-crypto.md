Title: “XRP is a ‘banker coin,’ created for banks and contradicting the ethos of crypto”
Summary: No, the ledger is openly accessible to anyone, and its technology supports use cases beyond institutional banking applications.

## Argument  
Because Ripple sells solutions to financial institutions, some claim XRP primarily exists to serve banks, conflicting with the decentralized spirit that defines many cryptocurrencies.

## Response  
While Ripple’s business strategy emphasizes partnerships with banks and payment providers, the underlying ledger is permissionless and open source. Individuals, independent developers, and smaller businesses can issue tokens, create decentralized exchanges, or conduct peer-to-peer transactions without requiring a bank’s endorsement. The technology itself does not impose limitations on who can participate.  
Moreover, many use cases for XRP and the XRP Ledger are unrelated to formal banking. Examples include micropayments, tokenized assets, and decentralized trading. Banks may find advantages in liquidity or instant settlement, but the infrastructure remains equally usable by casual participants or open-source projects. Consequently, categorizing XRP as solely a “banker coin” overlooks the broad range of users and developers who leverage its features for non-banking solutions.
