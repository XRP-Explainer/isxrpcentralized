Title: “XRP is centralized because Ripple has majority control”
Summary: No, the ledger is maintained by numerous independent validators, and no single entity, including Ripple, can unilaterally alter transactions or rules.

## Argument  
Ripple’s large XRP holdings and published validator lists are seen as evidence of central oversight, leading to the belief that Ripple effectively commands the network.

## Response  
The XRP Ledger is designed around a decentralized consensus protocol where each participant can choose which validators to trust. There is no requirement to use a specific list provided by any one organization. Although Ripple publishes a recommended Unique Node List (UNL), many independent validators and organizations maintain their own lists, reflecting diverse control.  
If Ripple were to propose harmful changes or attempt to dominate ledger decisions, other validators could opt out by removing Ripple-controlled nodes from their trusted sets. Because a consensus threshold must be reached among multiple independently chosen validators, any single entity seeking to override the network would face widespread rejection. This decentralized governance model keeps overall authority spread across many participants, ensuring no majority control rests with Ripple alone.
