Title: “Ripple dumps on retail from the monthly escrow”
Summary: No, sales from the escrow are typically small compared to total daily volumes, and large holders benefit more from maintaining a stable price.

## Argument  
Critics believe that each monthly escrow unlock leads to a major sell‑off, harming individual holders while benefiting Ripple.

## Response  
The monthly escrow release is strictly capped, and unsold XRP returns to escrow, preventing an arbitrary flood of tokens. In most months, the volume sold by Ripple is overshadowed by global trading activity, diminishing any single entity’s ability to dramatically move the price. This structure is deliberately transparent, allowing market participants to anticipate the maximum possible supply expansion for that period.  
Furthermore, holding substantial amounts of XRP naturally aligns Ripple’s interests with a favorable market price. A concerted effort to “dump” would reduce the value of the remainder, making it a counterproductive strategy. By operating within these orderly, on‑chain constraints, the escrow system contributes to market stability rather than sudden retail-targeted sell-offs.
