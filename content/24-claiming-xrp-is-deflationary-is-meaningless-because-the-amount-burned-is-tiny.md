Title: “Claiming ‘XRP is deflationary’ is meaningless because the amount burned is tiny”
Summary: No, with no new tokens entering the supply, even a small burn accumulates over time, ensuring net supply cannot expand indefinitely.

## Argument  
Some dismiss the burn rate of XRP transaction fees as too minor to matter in the long run, disputing any practical deflationary effect.

## Response  
Each transaction on the XRP Ledger destroys a small amount of XRP as a fee, removing those tokens from circulation. Although the per‑transaction burn is modest, no offsetting inflation mechanism creates additional tokens. Over extended periods and higher transaction volumes, the aggregate burn can become more significant, steadily diminishing the total supply.  
This structure contrasts with proof‑of‑work or proof‑of‑stake systems, which may produce new tokens as block rewards or staking incentives. Even if the net effect of burning is slight over short spans, it enforces a supply that can only remain static or shrink, never grow beyond the original 100 billion. This principle ensures no inflationary issuance can erode the relative scarcity of XRP.
