Title: “XRP’s large total supply means it can be dumped or flooded into the market”
Summary: No, most of the supply is locked in time-based escrows, and high daily trading volumes reduce the impact of any monthly release.

## Argument  
With 100 billion XRP existing from the start, critics worry a sudden release of tokens could crash the market price.

## Response  
The ledger’s escrow mechanism governs a significant share of XRP, ensuring that only a limited portion is released monthly. Any unutilized balance returns to escrow automatically, restricting how much can be introduced at once. This process is transparent, so observers always know the maximum possible released amount over a given month.  
Additionally, global XRP trading volume frequently reaches billions of tokens daily, meaning that even if the full monthly release were sold, it would likely be absorbed without extreme market disruption. Attempts to liquidate too aggressively would be counterproductive for large holders, who would diminish the value of their remaining assets. Ultimately, the structured release schedule and continuous trading volumes help maintain a stable supply flow, discrediting the notion of an unpredictable “flood.”
