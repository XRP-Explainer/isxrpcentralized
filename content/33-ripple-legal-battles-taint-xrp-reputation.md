Title: Ripple’s legal battles taint XRP’s reputation, scaring off serious institutional adoption
Summary: No, the 2023 SEC ruling clarified XRP’s non-security status for secondary markets, and institutional uptake via ODL continues to grow despite legal noise.

## Argument
Detractors argue that Ripple’s SEC lawsuit—even after the 2023 ruling—leaves a stink on XRP, spooking banks and big players who’d rather dodge the regulatory whiff than bet on its tech.

## Response
The “Ripple’s legal mess tanks XRP’s cred” moan is a drama queen take that’s losing steam. The SEC slugfest? It’s old news with a win: the 2023 ruling—Torres, Southern District of New York—nailed it: XRP ain’t a security on secondary markets, just some early Ripple sales got sloppy. Nearly 1,000 nodes keep the XRP Ledger purring—banks don’t care about courtroom reruns when the tech delivers. On-Demand Liquidity’s live, pumping funds from the U.S. to Mexico, Japan to Thailand—outfits like Tranglo and SBI Remit aren’t flinching; they’re doubling down.

Big players don’t spook that easy—finance moves slow, not scared. ODL’s corridors—40 payout markets by 2023, per X posts from Ripple—show adoption’s climbing, not crashing. Regulatory clarity’s the green light they craved, and the SEC’s bruised ego isn’t stopping Standard Chartered or fintechs like FINCI from testing the waters. XRP’s rep? It’s battle-scarred, not broken—banks see a ledger that settles in seconds, not a legal soap opera. Ripple’s the company catching flak; XRPL’s the chain, open and humming—legal dust ain’t clogging that engine.

Skeptics smell blood—too bad the wound’s healing. XRP’s not limping; it’s lapping up real use while the FUD fades.
