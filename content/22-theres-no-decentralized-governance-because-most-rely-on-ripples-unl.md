Title: “There’s no decentralized governance because most rely on Ripple’s UNL”
Summary: No, any node operator can adopt alternate validator lists, and multiple institutions publish their own, preventing a singular mandatory choice.

## Argument  
A recommended Unique Node List (UNL) from Ripple is sometimes viewed as exerting centralized governance over the ledger.

## Response  
The recommended list is precisely that—a recommendation. Node operators remain free to adopt different sets of validators, compile their own lists, or combine lists from various publishers. If Ripple introduced undesirable validators, the community could choose to follow competing lists, preserving a decentralized structure.  
Multiple independent organizations maintain and share validator lists, reflecting a network that does not hinge on the decisions of one entity. Decentralized governance arises from this flexibility: consensus demands a supermajority agreement among trusted validators, which each node configures for itself. This architectural model precludes centralized decision-making while allowing recognized publishers to offer curated lists if desired.
