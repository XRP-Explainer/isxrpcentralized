Title: “XRP simply moves with Bitcoin’s price, so it has no unique value”
Summary: No, although broader crypto trends may affect XRP’s short‑term volatility, the ledger’s speed and bridging features can drive distinct demand in cross‑border payments.

## Argument  
Critics maintain that XRP tracks Bitcoin market movements closely, implying no independent fundamentals or purpose.

## Response  
Short-term price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market often correlate with Bitcoin’s performance, a common phenomenon among numerous digital assets. However, over extended periods, assets can diverge based on their utility and adoption. XRP’s role in bridging different fiat currencies, providing instant settlement, and supporting tokenization can create demand outside general market trends.  
Participants focusing on cross-border remittances or micropayment platforms may elect to use XRP primarily for its efficiency rather than pure speculation. When these use cases grow, they can influence price dynamics that may not fully align with Bitcoin’s cycles. Thus, while market sentiment can link prices in the short run, XRP’s specialized ledger design fosters a separate utility base that can set it apart over time.
