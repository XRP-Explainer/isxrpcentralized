  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>Because Ripple sells solutions to financial institutions, some claim XRP primarily exists to serve banks, conflicting with the decentralized spirit that defines many cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>Sure, Ripple’s pitching to banks with shiny payment tech, but pinning XRP as a “banker coin” is like calling a Swiss Army knife a “chef’s tool” because it cuts veggies. The XRP Ledger’s wide open—permissionless, open-source, and built for anyone to use, no pinstripes required. Devs can spin up tokens, individuals can zip XRP peer-to-peer, and small players can tap it for whatever sparks their fancy. Rewind to XRP’s origin story: it was all about peer-to-peer payments, designed to dodge centralized gatekeepers like banks, not cozy up to them. That’s the root it grew from—freedom, not suits.</p>
<p>And it’s not just DIY dreamers riding the wave. Beyond banks, one of Ripple’s biggest customer crews is remittance companies—folks moving cash across borders who are sick of middleman banks skimming fees and dragging their feet. XRP’s speed and low cost let them slash the fat, settling payments in seconds instead of days. That’s not propping up Wall Street; it’s outflanking it. Banks might like the liquidity jolt or instant settlement, but remittance players are using XRP to chip away at the very centralized systems crypto was born to disrupt.</p>
<p>The ledger’s not picky—micropayments for a streamer’s tip jar, tokenized assets like digital land or art, or traders swapping on decentralized exchanges all fit the bill. Nearly 1,000 nodes, run by a scrappy mix of validators, keep it humming—no banker VIP list needed. Crypto’s ethos of cutting out overlords? XRP’s got it in its DNA, from its P2P genesis to its border-hopping hustle. Calling it a “banker coin” misses the forest for the trees—it’s a tool for the crowd, and the crowd’s running with it.</p>
