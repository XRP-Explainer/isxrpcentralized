  <h1>“FedNow consultation is meaningless, so XRP is not really used by the Federal Reserve”</h1>
  
  <!-- If your articles have a summary you want to display prominently: -->
  <div class="summary">
    <em><p>No, the Federal Reserve’s domestic instant payment system is separate from cross‑border liquidity solutions, and consulting does not confirm or deny XRP’s broader utility.</p></em>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Article body / content -->
  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>It is claimed that because FedNow does not rely on XRP, any consultation involving Ripple proves inconsequential to the token’s adoption.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>FedNow primarily addresses real-time settlement within the United States, focusing on domestic banks. XRP, by contrast, is often employed for bridging distinct currencies internationally. The fact that an entity may consult with the Federal Reserve on digital assets or instant payment trends does not guarantee immediate usage nor does it render the asset superfluous.<br>
Furthermore, government agencies frequently reach out to a range of private firms for guidance or opinions on emerging technologies. Whether or not a domestic payment system integrates XRP has minimal bearing on its cross-border role. Regulatory clarity and institutional acceptance in other contexts can still advance XRP’s presence in international remittance, multi-currency corridors, or corporate treasury solutions.</p>
