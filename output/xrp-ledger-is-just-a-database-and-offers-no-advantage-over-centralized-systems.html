  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>Some argue that XRPL is akin to a proprietary database system, suggesting it offers no improvements over typical payment processors.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “XRP Ledger’s just a database” jab is a lazy whiff that doesn’t get the plot. This isn’t a corporate toy—nearly 1,000 independent nodes grind out consensus, locking every transaction tight. Try censoring or rolling that back—once it’s in, it’s done, no mulligans. Centralized systems? One cranky admin can ice your account or zap your history in a heartbeat. Case in point: David Schwartz, a key XRPL brain, had his PayPal funds frozen on a whim back in the day. That lit a fire—he built the ledger to dodge that exact trap, crafting a system where no single hand can strangle your cash.</p>
<p>It’s not just tough—it’s loaded. The XRP Ledger rocked the first decentralized exchange (DEX), letting you trade XRP, stablecoins, or tokenized goodies without a gatekeeper skimming fees. Good luck finding that in a company database. Big shots like PayPal or bank servers are locked boxes—XRPL’s an open field, cryptographically sealed, with nearly 1,000 nodes standing guard. Any dev can jump in; no suit gets veto power. Speed’s under 4 seconds, costs are crumbs—centralized rigs can’t touch that freedom.</p>
<p>This isn’t “no advantage”—it’s a rebellion. Schwartz didn’t just tweak a database; he flipped the script on control after PayPal’s stunt. It’s not a corporate echo—it’s a crowd-run fortress, built to outmaneuver the old guard’s chokeholds.</p>
