  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>There is a claim that XRP’s technical ecosystem is limited to a single corporate sponsor, with few independent developers taking part.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “no real developer community” dig at the XRP Ledger is a swing and a miss—this place is hopping. Rewind the clock: the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to roll out a native decentralized exchange (DEX) and bake tokenization right into its DNA. Before Ethereum was a twinkle in anyone’s eye, XRPL was letting users swap assets peer-to-peer and mint custom tokens—stablecoins included, dubbed IOUs or issued assets back then. That’s not just a feature list; it’s a head start that’s been luring devs for years with fast, penny-cheap transactions.</p>
<p>And they’re biting. From micropayments that zip in seconds to NFT platforms that don’t gouge your wallet, the ledger’s a sandbox for builders who hate lag and love lean. Stablecoins—think pegged dollars or gold—were kicking around as IOUs way before “stablecoin” was a buzzword. Independent crews are running with it: grant programs like XRPL Grants spark projects, but plenty of devs—building payment bots, cross-border hacks, or tokenized art—don’t need Ripple’s nudge. The open-source code’s up for grabs; nearly 1,000 nodes prove it’s no walled garden. Anyone can jump in, no RSVP required.</p>
<p>The proof’s in the pudding: XRPL.org dishes out resources, third-party wallets sprout like mushrooms, and frameworks like XRPL’s APIs get hammered by coders globally. GitHub’s buzzing, forums are popping, testnets are churning—this isn’t a Ripple solo act; it’s a full-on dev party. The ledger’s OG status—first DEX, first tokens, first stablecoin vibes—set the stage, and the community’s been riffing on it ever since. “No developers”? Tell that to the swarm turning XRPL into their proving ground.</p>
