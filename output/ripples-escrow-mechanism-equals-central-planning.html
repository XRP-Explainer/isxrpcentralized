  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>By controlling the times and amounts of XRP’s monthly releases, Ripple allegedly exercises a form of central economic planning over the asset.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “escrow is central planning” gripe about XRP doesn’t survive a reality check. Escrow’s a native XRP Ledger feature—open to all, not a Ripple special. It’s powered by a hash time-lock contract (HTLC), the same native gear Bitcoin’s had in its toolkit since day one. Ripple’s using it for their own funds: 1 billion XRP from their stash unlocks monthly, and if any goes unused, they shove it back into escrow for another 55 months. When those contracts expire, that XRP slides back to Ripple’s wallet—not new coins, just theirs on a timer. All 100 billion XRP were issued at the ledger’s kickoff—no extras, ever. Every single one’s been on-chain, touched by at least one transaction, not fresh off the press.</p>
<p>This isn’t Ripple cooking up new XRP; it’s cycling what’s already out there. Nearly 1,000 nodes run invariant checks to nix any funny stuff—total supply’s locked, no surprises. HTLC’s native to both XRPL and Bitcoin—XRP escrows with it, BTC swaps with it—and Ripple’s moves are on-chain, blatant as daylight. Traders and hodlers clock the rhythm, pricing it in—no “planning” panic needed. Compare that to Michael Saylor, hoarding over 200,000 BTC with no leash—big pile, no cries of control. Escrow’s a transparent beat, not a takeover—100 billion issued, tracked, and rolling since the start. Check the ledger; it’s a pulse, not a plot.</p>
