  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>It is asserted that the token was imposed on the crypto space by creators looking to profit, instead of arising from genuine community interest.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “nobody wanted XRP, it was forced to enrich founders” gripe is a flimsy tale that doesn’t match the tape. The XRP Ledger didn’t storm in with a gun to anyone’s head—it dropped as an open-source project, free for anyone to poke, prod, or pass on. No one had to buy a ticket; folks stumbled onto it because it’s fast—under 4 seconds—and doesn’t guzzle resources like Proof-of-Work dinosaurs. That’s not coercion; that’s a shiny tool catching eyes. Nearly 1,000 nodes later, it’s clear—users, devs, and outfits like remittance firms latched on organically, building payment rails, token plays, and swaps because it works.</p>
<p>Yeah, founders like Jed McCaleb snagged big chunks early—100 billion XRP hit the ledger at genesis, and they got theirs. But it’s all on-chain, tracked to the drop—no secret vaults or surprise mints; the supply’s capped, no extras sneaking in. “Forced”? Tell that to the market—XRP’s price and liquidity grew because people traded it, used it, wanted it—not because Ripple held a whip. Founders can’t print more to cash out; they’re riding the same wave as everyone else. Compare that to ICOs fleecing rubes with nothing built—XRPL’s a machine, not a scam.</p>
<p>This isn’t a top-down shove; it’s bottom-up pull. The ledger’s open—coders fork it, nodes run it, adopters shape it. Price in Sats? Steady as a rock eight years on—market’s call, not a founder’s fiat. “Enriching” implies a heist; here, it’s just early birds who bet big and let the crowd decide. XRP’s here because it stuck—not because it was rammed down throats.</p>
