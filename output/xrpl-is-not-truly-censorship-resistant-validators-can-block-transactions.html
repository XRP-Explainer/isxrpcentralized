    <em><p>No, colluding validators lose their standing once honest nodes remove them from trust lists, making broad censorship unfeasible.</p></em>

  <!-- Article body / content -->
  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>Because the ledger relies on validator agreement, some argue that an orchestrated group could suppress or reorder transactions at will.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “XRPL isn’t censorship-resistant” knock because validators call the shots is a misread that crumbles under scrutiny. In the XRP Ledger’s consensus setup, every node—nearly 1,000 strong—curates its own VIP list of trusted validators. If a shady clique tries to block or monkey with legit transactions, honest nodes can just ditch them—yank those validators from their trust lists and keep rolling. Censorship only sticks if a fat chunk of the network’s in on the plot, and good luck corralling a sprawling, diverse crew into that kind of conspiracy. It’s not a house of cards; it’s a web with teeth.</p>
<p>Contrast that with proof-of-work’s Achilles’ heel: a mining pool with 51% of the hashrate can ghost transactions solo, no debate needed—just raw power. XRPL flips the script. No single outfit or small gang can choke the flow—consensus needs a supermajority of validators nodes actually trust, not a hash-rate flex. If a few go rogue, the network’s got nearly 1,000 eyes to spot it and cut them loose. Validators don’t rule; they’re hired help—mess up, and they’re fired by the crowd.</p>
<p>Decentralization’s the muscle here. Those nodes aren’t Ripple’s puppets—they’re run by a motley mix of outfits, devs, and users worldwide, each picking their own validator posse. Try censoring that, and you’re herding cats with a toothpick. The ledger’s built to shrug off bad actors—honest nodes pivot fast, keeping the chain clean. It’s not fragile; it’s antifragile—colluders don’t just fail, they lose their seat at the table. Censorship? More like a self-correcting buzzsaw.</p>
