  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>Because some banks opt only for the messaging layer of RippleNet, critics see this as proof that they reject XRP altogether.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “bank partnerships are meaningless ’cause they don’t use XRP” jab is a swing that doesn’t land when you unpack the setup. RippleNet’s its own beast—a standalone network, not a blockchain, and it doesn’t lean on crypto or the XRP Ledger out of the gate. It’s a turbo-charged messaging system, hauling banks out of the stone age with cleaner, cheaper payment flows. But here’s the twist: when banks want to kick it up a notch, RippleNet can tap the XRP Ledger through On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), plugging in XRP for lightning-fast cross-border settlements. Many start with just the messaging, trimming fat and flubs, then eye ODL to wield XRP’s speed when they’re ready.</p>
<p>This isn’t banks dodging XRP—it’s them easing in. Traditional finance doesn’t leap to digital assets overnight; it’s a compliance crawl—test the waters, then dive deeper. RippleNet’s the shallow end: modernize first, cut costs, build trust. Then ODL’s the bridge—linking to the XRP Ledger’s nearly 1,000 nodes for real-time transfers, no pre-funded accounts clogging the pipes. Look at corridors like Japan to the UAE: messaging paves the way, XRP steps in when the timing’s right. It’s not a snub; it’s a staircase.</p>
<p>Dismissing partnerships because “they just use RippleNet” is like trashing a toolbox for not using the hammer first. RippleNet’s a separate track—non-blockchain, flexible—and ODL’s the hookup to XRP when banks green-light it. The groundwork’s real, not a fake-out—messaging today, XRP tomorrow. It’s not pointless; it’s phased.</p>
