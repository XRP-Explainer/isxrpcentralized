  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>With 100 billion XRP existing from the start, critics worry a sudden release of tokens could crash the market price.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “XRP’s massive supply will flood the market” scare is a ghost that doesn’t haunt the numbers. Most of those 100 billion tokens are caged in time-based escrows, not rattling loose. Each month, 1 billion XRP steps out, but Ripple doesn’t just let the leftovers drift—they put any unused portion back into escrow for another 55-month stint. It’s a controlled drip, not a deluge, and it’s all on-chain, plain as day. Anyone can peek at the max that might drop—no cloak-and-dagger chaos here.</p>
<p>Compare that to Bitcoin, where miners live to dump. Their economic playbook is literally “mine it, sell it”—pumping fresh BTC into the market to bankroll their rigs. Over the years, way more Bitcoin’s been unloaded this way than XRP’s ever seen from escrow releases. XRP’s monthly billion is peanuts next to BTC’s relentless miner flood—yet nobody’s crying “scam” over that. XRP’s daily trading volume, clocking billions of tokens globally, shrugs off the escrow trickle like it’s nothing. The market’s got the depth to swallow it whole without a hiccup.</p>
<p>Big holders like Ripple aren’t dumb either—dumping hard would crater the price, slashing their own stash’s worth. Why saw off the branch you’re sitting on? That’s why escrow’s paced out, keeping the flow steady, not frantic. Oh, and here’s a fun fact: XRP’s price in Sats is basically parked where it was eight years ago—two full Bitcoin halving cycles, and it’s barely budged. No wild flood crashing its value there. With nearly 1,000 nodes humming and a transparent rhythm, XRP’s supply isn’t a tsunami—it’s a stream, and the market’s been sailing it smooth.</p>
