  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>Because the XRP Ledger lacks block rewards or staking yields, some conclude that no one will maintain honest operation long-term.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “XRP has no incentives, so it’ll flop” claim is a dud when you eyeball who’s powering the network. Nearly 1,000 nodes aren’t humming for handouts—banks, exchanges, and die-hard tinkerers run them because the XRP Ledger’s a fast, cheap, no-BS lifeline. They’re not panning for mining gold or staking crumbs; they want ironclad access—transactions locked in under 4 seconds, no gatekeepers. Financial crews use it for cross-border blasts, traders for smooth swaps, indies for token gigs. The real perk? A network that delivers, not a token tap.</p>
<p>Check Bitcoin—tens of thousands of non-mining nodes spin up for zilch too. No block rewards there, just folks wanting a direct line to the chain. Same deal with XRP: running your own node’s the only bulletproof way to dodge third-party flak—middlemen can’t fudge your view or throttle your moves. PoW’s big pools and PoS’s whale stakers might hog rewards and clout, but XRPL skips that circus. No energy slugfest, no capital cage match—just a lean consensus where nodes thrive on low overhead and high uptime.</p>
<p>It’s not charity; it’s smarts. Validators keep it tight for their own skin—client cash, trading edge, or DIY passion—not some payout carrot. Rewards can centralize clout; XRPL’s utility scatters it. Bitcoin’s non-miners and XRP’s node runners bet on the same truth: control your access, and the network’s yours. “No incentives”? Nah—it’s too damn useful to need a bribe.</p>
