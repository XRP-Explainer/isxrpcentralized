  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>It is sometimes claimed that Ripple or particular validators hold a “freeze switch” to reverse or halt user balances, raising concerns about potential censorship.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The idea that Ripple or the XRP Ledger can freeze your XRP transactions is a ghost story that won’t die—but it’s still dead wrong. The core protocol has no “freeze switch” for native XRP. Once a transaction hits the consensus mark, it’s locked into the ledger’s history, untouchable and irreversible. No validator, no node runner, not even Ripple’s bigwigs can claw it back or slap a padlock on it. Nearly 1,000 nodes churn through every move, running invariant checks to keep the books bulletproof—one rogue player can’t rewrite the script.</p>
<p>A go-to example folks love to trot out is Jed McCaleb, Ripple’s former founder. The tale goes that his funds got “seized” when he split from the company, proof of some XRP freeze power. Except, here’s the twist: Jed sold his XRP for USD, and it was that pile of dollars—not his XRP—that got frozen. Big difference. If he’d kept his stash in XRP, no one could’ve touched it—there’s no mechanism in the ledger to freeze native XRP, period. His USD got snagged in the messy world of centralized exchanges and courts, not XRP. It’s a classic case of mixing up fiat handcuffs with cryptocurrency freedom.</p>
<p>The confusion often spills over from issued assets—tokens or IOUs on the ledger that issuers can freeze if they set them up that way. Think a company tethering tokens to euros or gold, needing a compliance lever. That’s their sandbox, not XRP’s. Native XRP doesn’t bend to those rules—it’s immune. Ripple or validators meddling with XRP transactions? No dice—consensus needs a crowd, not a king. Jed’s story proves the point: XRP stayed untouchable; it was the cash-out that tripped him up. Censorship’s off the table for the base asset—full stop.</p>
