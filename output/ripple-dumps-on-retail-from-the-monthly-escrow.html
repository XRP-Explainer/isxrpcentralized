  <h2>Argument</h2>
<p>Critics believe that each monthly escrow unlock leads to a major sell‑off, harming individual holders while benefiting Ripple.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>The “Ripple dumps escrow XRP on retail” cry is a bogeyman that doesn’t match the math. That monthly unlock? It’s a tight leash—1 billion XRP max from Ripple’s own stash, and anything unsold gets shoved back into escrow for another 55 months. No wild floods here; it’s a trickle, and it’s all on-chain, loud and clear. Zoom out: global XRP trading volume hits billions daily—Ripple’s typical sell-off, often a fraction of that billion, is a pebble in the pond. The market’s a beast; it doesn’t flinch at this drip when exchanges are already churning mountains of tokens.</p>
<p>Ripple’s not rubbing its hands like a cartoon villain either. With a fat pile of XRP still in their grip, tanking the price would be like setting their own wallet on fire—every dumped coin slashes the worth of what’s left. Big holders win by keeping things steady, not sparking a freefall. That’s why the escrow’s a coded cage, not a firehose—nearly 1,000 nodes track it, and traders price in the cap like clockwork. “Dumping on retail”? More like a yawn next to the daily grind—XRP’s price in Sats hasn’t budged much in eight years despite these releases. It’s stability, not sabotage.</p>
<p>This isn’t some sneaky heist; it’s a transparent play. The ledger’s rules lock Ripple into a predictable groove—retail’s not the punching bag, and the volumes prove it. Critics see a boogeyman; the data sees a snooze. Escrow’s a metronome, not a market wrecker.</p>
